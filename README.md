ESP8266 Weather Station in Color using ILI9341 TFT 240x320 display

## Hardware Requirements

1. SQUIX

This code is made for an 240x320 65K ILI9341 display with code running on an ESP8266.
Since it was sometimes complicated to find the right parts I created a kit which contains all the parts including the connector PCB:

By buying the kit from me you are supporting future development. Thank you!
