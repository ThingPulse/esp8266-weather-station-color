## Changes by Lorol
[![converter-tool](resources/converter-tool/tool.png)](https://rawgit.com/lorol/esp8266-weather-station-color/master/resources/converter-tool/display.htm)
* Added a converter tool (click the picture above) to generate C code from own images. 
* Alternative set of icons generated by this converter tool. Compile with weathericons2.h or weathericons.h to see difference.
* A "Screen saver" instead of "Deep sleep" concept after timeout 15 min. See settings.h. Turning ON by touch and hold the lower zone of OLED.
* Added a battery icon for further implementation. Touching the battery icon activates the "Screen saver".
* Force update by touching Wifi icon.
* Fix for [last two wrong icon entries](https://github.com/squix78/esp8266-weather-station-color/issues/39) & added night time icons processing. 
* These changes depend on [esp8266-weather-station](https://github.com/lorol/esp8266-weather-station) modification, too!
* Fix of 00:00:00 clock after forecasts update.
* Multiple WiFi credentials.

## Hardware Requirements

1. SQUIX

This code is made for an 240x320 65K ILI9341 display with code running on an ESP8266.
Since it was sometimes complicated to find the right parts I created a kit which contains all the parts including the connector PCB:

By buying the kit from me you are supporting future development. Thank you!

2. AZSMZ TFT

cxandy created a nice adaptation of this code to run with the hardware from AZSMZ:
